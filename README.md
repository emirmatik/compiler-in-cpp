# Compiler in C++

Simple Compiler of an arbitrary language made in C ++

**Note: Do not forget to write your file name as the input source in main section** <br/>
**Note2: You need to store your all operations in a variable. Because it outputs only variables currently. (Will be changed)**

## Abilities of the Compiler
- Understands variable assignments.
- Solves simple math calculations with considering operator and paranthese priority ðŸ’ª. <br/>
- Solves simple IF-ELSE statement  <br/>
- Also it is able to solve simpe FOR statement as well!! <br/>
- Distiguishes INT and DOUBLE data types in its calculations. <br/>

## Input / Language Syntax

- ### Variable Assignment <br/>
  VARIABLE_NAME = VALUE <br/><br/>
  <b>Example:<b/> A = 5
  
- ### Math
  '+' , '-' , '*' , '/'  <br/><br/>
  <b>Example:<b/> A * B - 13 + 75

- ### IF-ELSE STATEMENT
  IF CONDITION THEN OUTPUT1 ELSE OUTPUT2 <br/><br/>
  <b>Example:<b/> C = IF (A + B) < 15 THEN A ELSE 25 <br/>
                                 
- ### FOR STATEMENT 
  LOOP VARIABLE_NAME = VARIABLE_NAME + 5 TIMES COUNT <br/><br/>
  <b>Example:<b/> LOOP C = C + A * B TIMES 15 <br/>
  
- ### OUTPUT 
  OUT VARIABLE_NAME <br/><br/>
  <b>Example:<b/> OUT B
